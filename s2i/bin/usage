This is an S2I tomcat-7.0.105 running with java-6 compiling with ant-1.9 centos base image responsible for consuming a java maven tomcat project
and deploying it onto Apache-Tomcat application server.
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image.

Sample invocation:

s2i build https://github.com/h3nrique/systemprops.git h3nrique/s2i-tomcat7-java7-ant19:latest demoapp -e WAR_NAME=systemprops.war

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -p 8080:8080 demoapp

Details:
If a build.xml is present in the source directory, the project is built with ant and the
output war file defined with WAR_NAME will be copied into the Tomcat webapps directory.

You can specify the path to the build.xml file to build into your git repo with BUILD_XML_PATH. (defaut set to .)

If there is no build.xml, but the war specified with WAR_NAME is found, it will be moved to tomcat webapps directory.

The default Ant build arguments can be overridden by setting ANT_ARGS via the "--env" argument to S2I
default ANT_ARGS is empty.
The default Ant build arguments can be appended by setting ANT_ARGS_APPEND.
